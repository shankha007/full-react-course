Using a Build WorkFlow:
    WHY?
    1. Optimize Code
    2. Use Next-Gen JavaScript Features
    3. Be More Productive

    HOW?
    1. Use Dependency Management Tool (npm or yarn)
    2. Use Bundler (Recommended: Webpack)
    3. Use Compiler for Next-Gen JS (Babel + Presets)
    4. Use a Development Server


First install create-react-app: npm install create-react-app -g
Then run the following command: create-react-app react-complete-guide --scripts-version 1.1.5

Folder Structure:
package.json -> All dependencies are shown here. All scripts are also written here
node_modules -> All the dependencies are held here.
public -> It is the root folder which is served by the Webserver. Holds the only html file as it is a single page application. We can edit this if we want.
src -> The source files resides here. We will mostly work here.

Stateful vs Stateless ->
    Any component that manages state in it is called Stateful Component. It is also called Smart or Container Component.
    Any component that does not manahe state in it is called Stateless Component. It is also called Dumb or Presentational Component.
